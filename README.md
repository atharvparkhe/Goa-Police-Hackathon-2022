## Drishti App

#### Non-Cognisible Offense Records System

#### An explanation of the problem statement
- We have identified in our societies that most of the people that go on to become greater miscreants start out young and often perform repeated crimes maybe on small scales
- These people are often known to the local police but due to small degree crimes they are often let go with warnings left with no paper trail to trace and keep track of their activity.
- If we manage to maintain a record of these people with the local police it will be as though that we have eyes on them all the while and record their activities and access their details in potential cases

#### Proposed solution to the problem statement

- App based solution such that whenever any person is brought into the police station for whatever reason like a fist fight, verbal abuse, potential theft suspision, rash driving etc.
- Police official shall record and store it on the data base local to area of activity of that person along with his/her details. -Even if there is no conclusion to the case or if there is common scenario of "compromise" in the parties the details wll be still be stored for future reference.
How will this help?
- It will create fear among youngsers of getting tagged in the society
- It will help carve an identity/personality of that person repeatedly brought in and it will serve as a rich storehouse to look into if a similar case is registered in an area with unidentified suspects
